I’m an Embedded Software Engineer focused on building efficient, reproducible, and scalable embedded systems.

With experience across firmware, electronics, and PCB design—as well as backend development (.NET), networking, Docker, and GitLab CI/CD—I design tools and automation that unify these domains, simplifying development and deployment pipelines.

My multidisciplinary background enables me to bridge diverse teams by connecting system-level thinking with practical implementation.

I believe that every collaboration is an opportunity to learn something new from others and to grow both technically and professionally.
