## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Iâ€™m an **Embedded Software Engineer** focused on building **efficient**, **reproducible**, and **scalable** embedded systems.

With experience across **firmware**, **electronics**, and **PCB design** â€” as well as **backend development (.NET)**, **networking**, **Docker**, and **GitLab CI/CD** â€” I design tools and automation that unify these domains, simplifying development and deployment pipelines.

My **multidisciplinary background** enables me to bridge diverse teams by connecting **system-level thinking** with **practical implementation**.

I believe that every collaboration is an opportunity to **learn something new**, grow **technically**, and **professionally**.
